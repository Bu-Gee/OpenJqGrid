OpenJqGrid
==========

This is a free/libre fork from the last free version of jqGrid.  

This has been forked from jqGrid 4.7.0, git commit
8d0342f420138e0f41537757d5a388bb4e6ad498, which was the last version
to be released under the MIT/GPL2 license.

This fork aims to fix small bugs in the code and generally keep up to
date with the latest versions of jQuery and jQuery UI.

I do not expect that I will ever submit a pull request to the parent
project, but if you feel like I should, please let me know and I'll
consider it.

Conversely, changes, especially those that are bug fixes, are welcome
either in the form of pull requests or diffs.

The details of the project have been retained below, but they will
quickly become more and more out of date as new features are added to
the main project.


Old Project Info
================

jQuery grid plugin

jqGrid is an Ajax-enabled JavaScript control that provides solutions for 
representing and manipulating tabular data on the web. Since the grid is a 
client-side solution loading data dynamically through Ajax callbacks, it can be
integrated with any server-side technology, including PHP, ASP, Java Servlets, 
JSP, ColdFusion, and Perl.

jqGrid uses a jQuery JavaScript Library and is written as plugin for that 
package. For more information on jQuery, please see <a href="http://jquery.com/">(jQuery.com)</a>.

jqGrid's Home page can be found at <a href="http://www.trirand.com/blog">trirand.com</a>.
